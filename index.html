                                        Building a model to predict the likelihood of customer payments was a portion of the 
                                        project that me and a few of my colleagues were tasked with. We developed a machine

                                        payment likelihood based on historical transaction and geographical data. To achieve 
                                        this, we extracted the data that was stored in MySQL and MongoDB, and then we 
                                        cleaned/processed the data using SQL for feature engineering.
